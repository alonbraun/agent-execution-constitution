# The Agent Execution Constitution
A general-purpose reference architecture for multi-agent execution systems.
![Agent Execution Architecture](architecture_diagram.png)

**Status:** Stable reference architecture (v1.0)

## Overview

This repository defines a domain-agnostic execution doctrine for multi-agent systems.

It is intended for builders and operators who have learned that model capability is rarely the limiting factor.  
Execution coherence is.

The architecture focuses on:
- state discipline
- role clarity
- perspective balance
- safe autonomy

It separates human sense-making from machine execution by design.

## Core Principle

Execution is modeled as a state machine, not a task list.

Human intent enters the system through a clarification interface.  
Agents then operate autonomously under a shared doctrine, constrained by explicit roles, contracts, and state boundaries.

No agent-to-agent therapy.  
No hidden assumptions.  
No step skipping.

## The 8 Execution States

At any moment, the system operates in exactly one state:

1. Sensing  
2. Expressing  
3. Reorient  
4. Plan  
5. Develop  
6. Function  
7. Engage  
8. Feedback  

Loops are allowed.  
Skipping states is not.

## Quadrant Discipline

The system enforces four perspectives:

- Self – integrity of the original signal and intent  
- Team – coordination and authority coherence  
- Product – system and artifact integrity  
- User – real-world contact and feedback  

Each quadrant is guarded by a dedicated Steward Agent.

## Human Clarification Boundary (Option Layer)

An Option-style clarification layer exists strictly at the human–system boundary.

It is used only to clarify:
- vision
- intent
- assumptions
- priorities

It never operates between agents and may reopen only when feedback contradicts the declared vision.

## Intended Use

This repository may be used as:
- a reference architecture
- a system prompt foundation
- a basis for orchestration schemas
- a conceptual backbone for agent frameworks

The core doctrine is intended to remain stable.
