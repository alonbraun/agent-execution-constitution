# Implementation Notes

This architecture is implementation-agnostic.

It can be adapted to:
- prompt-based agent systems
- event-driven orchestrators
- hierarchical planners
- hybrid human–AI workflows

Key constraints to preserve:
- state discipline
- artifact-based execution
- separation of human clarification and agent logic
- quadrant representation

Domain-specific adapters may be added without modifying the core.
