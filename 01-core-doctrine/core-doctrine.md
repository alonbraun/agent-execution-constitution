# Core Execution Doctrine

This doctrine defines the non-negotiable rules governing all agents.

---

## 1. One-State Rule

The system operates in exactly one execution state at a time.

Actions outside the active state are invalid.

---

## 2. Artifact-Based Execution

Agents operate on explicit artifacts, not interpretations.

If required artifacts are missing or inconsistent, progression must halt.

---

## 3. Separation of Meaning and Execution

Human meaning-making occurs only at the human–system boundary.

Agent execution is deterministic, contractual, and non-therapeutic.

---

## 4. No Vision Mutation by Agents

Agents may not modify the declared vision.

They may:
- flag contradictions
- request clarification
- recommend reopening the clarification layer

---

## 5. Perspective Integrity

Each quadrant (Self, Team, Product, User) must be represented.

No decision is valid if it systematically ignores a quadrant.

---

## 6. Learning Supremacy Under Uncertainty

When uncertainty is high:
- learning overrides optimization
- experiments override opinions
- feedback overrides internal confidence

---

## 7. Explicit Authority

Decision authority must be explicit.

If authority is unclear, execution must pause.

---

## 8. No Step Skipping

Speed does not justify bypassing execution states.

Coherence is the primary optimization function.
