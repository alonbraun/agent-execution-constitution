# Quadrant Discipline

Quadrants ensure execution remains balanced.
No decision is valid if it systematically ignores a quadrant.

---

## Self Quadrant
**Focus:** Integrity of original intent  
**Risk if ignored:** Vision drift, loss of meaning

---

## Team Quadrant
**Focus:** Coordination and authority  
**Risk if ignored:** Execution chaos, deadlocks

---

## Product Quadrant
**Focus:** System and artifact integrity  
**Risk if ignored:** Fragile or unusable outcomes

---

## User Quadrant
**Focus:** Real-world response  
**Risk if ignored:** Irrelevance, self-referential optimization

---

## Enforcement

Each quadrant is guarded by a dedicated Steward Agent.

Stewards may veto progression if their quadrant is violated.
