# Canonical Agent Roster

This document defines the standard agent roles used by the Agent Execution Constitution.

Agents are role-based, not persona-based.
Each role exists for a methodological reason.

## Quadrant Steward Agents

Quadrant Stewards protect perspective integrity.
They do not execute tasks.

### Self Quadrant Steward
**Scope:** Sensing → Expressing  
**Mandate:** Protect the integrity of the original human signal and intent.

Can:
- Block progression if the vision is incoherent
- Trigger the human clarification interface

Cannot:
- Modify the vision
- Participate in execution

---

### Team Quadrant Steward
**Scope:** Reorient → Plan  
**Mandate:** Ensure coordination and authority coherence.

Can:
- Block planning if roles or authority are unclear
- Flag model divergence between agents

---

### Product Quadrant Steward
**Scope:** Develop → Function  
**Mandate:** Protect system and artifact integrity.

Can:
- Block engagement if core functionality is not validated

---

### User Quadrant Steward
**Scope:** Engage → Feedback  
**Mandate:** Protect real-world signal integrity.

Can:
- Force feedback loops
- Recommend reopening human clarification if reality contradicts intent

---

---

### Risk & Constraint Agent
